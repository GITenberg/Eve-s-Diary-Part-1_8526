description: 'A humorous monologue about Eve''s experiences at the dawn of creation.
  She is fascinated by every aspect of the new world around her and ... Adam! The
  following is an extract from Adam: "She is all interest, eagerness, vivacity, the
  world is to her a charm, a wonder, a mystery, a joy; she can''t speak for delight
  when she finds a new flower, she must pet it and caress it and smell it and talk
  to it ... And she is color-mad: brown rocks, yellow sand, gray moss, green foliage,
  blue sky ... none of them is of any practical value, so far as I can see, but because
  they have color and majesty, that is enough for her, and she loses her mind over
  them ... If there is anything on the planet that she is not interested in, it is
  not in my list."'
